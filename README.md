# UNA

UNA helps users track their daily food intake.  The app focusses on simple data input and representation in an effort to make the process fun!

UNA was built with the Ruby on Rails web development framework as a project for General Assembly Australia's Software Engineering Immersive course.

The app makes use of several gems (chartkick, jquery-rails, bulma) and the PostgreSQL database suite.  You can visit a live version of the website at https://protected-reaches-75801.herokuapp.com/

This app was my first foray in to the world of Rails and the MVC architectural pattern, and whilst I'm happy with it from a learning standpoint there's still a lot of functionality that I'd like to improve upon later down the track.
